The HTTP service has resources in the following form:

/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties
where application is injected as the spring.config.name in the SpringApplication 
(what is normally application in a regular Spring Boot app), profile is an active profile (or comma-separated list of properties), 
and label is an optional git label (defaults to master.)
